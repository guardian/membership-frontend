  // Even though a request to identity API is made when this method is called,

  // The analogous PR gives an idea:
  // https://github.com/guardian/subscriptions-frontend/pull/1265
  //
  // It was deemed that the risk of a bug being introduced by refactoring to use Futures
  // was greater than the risk of a user getting a slower than normal response
  // (as a result of all threads available to execute this method call being blocked).
  // The latter was considered low risk, since the membership-frontend app is low traffic
  // and a dedicated thread pool of 30 threads has been reserved
  // to execute these blocking calls (c.f. Authentication.unsafeInit()).
  // The fact that membership-frontend is a deprecated application also factored into the decision.
