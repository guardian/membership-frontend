                    We want to make the world a better, fairer place. We want to keep the powerful honest. We aim to keep society informed by producing quality, independent journalism, which discovers and tells readers the truth. At Guardian Australia we shine a light on critical, under-reported stories across Australia and deliver the best of the Guardian’s work from reporters around the globe. Our independent ownership allows us to produce award-winning journalism free from commercial influence. No-one can edit our editor.
                </p>
                <p class="u-responsive-p">
                    Your support is crucial for us to maintain this. We operate a lean, local news organisation with offices in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, and correspondents in other states. But our commercial environment is increasingly challenging and advertising revenues are in decline. So if you read us, if you like us, if you value our perspective – then it’s only fair to become a Supporter and help make our future in Australia more secure.
