    * Get the Call-To-Action that occurs on the buy-ticket button. This info is written out to the cached Event Details

    * user is) to display the appropriate CTA.
    *
    * Rules for the CTA
    * - If event is not on sale to anyone return 'unavailable' status object for ALL users
    * - If event is within priority booking mode and user is not logged-in return 'join' status object
    * - If event is within priority booking mode, and user is logged-in user with a tier sale start date in the
    * future return 'upgrade' status object
    * - If event is within priority booking mode, and user is logged-in user with a tier sale start date in the
    * past return empty 'buy' status object
    * - If event is on sale to everyone, and user is logged-in with or without a tier return empty 'buy' status object
